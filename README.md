My name is Youssef el habchi, from [React Native Master](https://rn-master.com) I welcome each and everyone of you.



Hello everyone, and welcome into this new article where we are going to explore how to use React Native [Share](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/share).  
In this article we will consume the Share API from React Native, to share a feed post from your app to any social media.

To Achieve this I will create a simple social media app feed card with a post content of an image, title, body text and share button.  
Something similar to most social media or blog apps posts out there.


Feel free to read the whole article on my blog [React Native Share Posts Example](https://rn-master.com/react-native-share-posts-example/)
If you would like to try the app on Expo, I have prepared an expo project, check it from  [Expo.io](https://expo.io/@alhydra/react-native-share-posts-example)
